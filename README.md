# Car Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning regression model to predict used car prices using features such as year, mileage, brand, fuel type, and more.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Contains features such as year, engine size, fuel type, mileage, tax, mpg, price, etc.
- Cleaned and preprocessed for modeling.

## 🛠️ Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature engineering
5. Model selection and training
6. Evaluation using regression metrics
7. Conclusion

## 📍 Final Model Performance
Describe your best model’s performance, why it was selected, and what metrics you used (MAE, RMSE, R², etc.).

## 💡 Observations & Insights
- Which features strongly influence price?
- Any surprising patterns?
- How well did the model generalize?
